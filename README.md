As a stepping stone to my SandBocks project, I want to make a simpler project which could also utilise the same hardware. So similarly, it will start off as a python/pygame implementation of snake, then move to a c++/arduino version.

This snake game is unique as the food, or bugs, move just like the bugs in SandBocks. They will just move randomly, but stay still occasionally.
